    In the shadows of a once-great empire, I move silently, a nameless figure
    watching the serpents weave their web of deceit. Where others are fooled by
    the Fasiqoon's masks, I see the truth beneath. I do not fight with words
    like Ibn Tariq or rally the masses; my work is done in the dark, where no
    one dares to look. A ghost in the corridors of power, my blade strikes
    swiftly, leaving no trace but the whisper of justice. I am the unseen hand,
    the unspoken threat to those who betray the faith. In a world where
    hypocrisy thrives, I remain in the shadowsâ€”silent, patient, deadly.
